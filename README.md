# FLASK-DROPDOWN

## OVERVIEW

The idea was to implement a reading of the database tables that have the car brands and models. This information is converted into a python dictionary to feed the two drop down boxes. When selecting the car make, the application displays in the second drop down box the car models that correspond to the car make in ``` @app.route('/_update_dropdown') ```

### Tools
 * Python (Flask)
 * Flask-SQLAlchemy
 * Postgres
